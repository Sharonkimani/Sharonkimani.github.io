# Sharon Kimani - Data Scientist | Data Analyst

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I showcase my passion for data science, machine learning, and data analysis. As a dedicated data science graduate with a strong foundation in Actuarial Science, I'm enthusiastic about using my skills to drive impactful business solutions and provide valuable insights.

## About Me

I'm a highly motivated individual who thrives on combining the power of data with advanced analytical techniques. My unique blend of Actuarial Science knowledge and data science expertise enables me to tackle complex challenges in risk assessment, pricing strategies, and financial decision-making.

## Projects

### Deep Learning Model for Sign Language Translation

In this project, I tackled the challenge of improving communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments. By developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, I successfully recognized fingerspelling gestures in Kenyan Sign Language (KSL). Despite hurdles related to dataset size and image quality, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of over 90 percent on the test dataset. I'm actively exploring ways to expand the dataset, enhance image quality, and extend the modelâ€™s capabilities. This project is dedicated to promoting inclusivity and facilitating effective communication across diverse language communities, positively impacting the lives of those with hearing impairments.

### Forecasting House Prices for a Real Estate Firm

This project delved into the realm of real estate by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the housing market. By leveraging time series modeling techniques, my team and I identified promising investment opportunities. After evaluating various metrics and models, including Auto Regressive, ARIMA, and SARIMA, we pinpointed New York as consistently demonstrating high return on investment. Meanwhile, cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles showcased attractive returns with lower associated risk. These findings serve as invaluable insights for making informed decisions in the realm of real estate investment.

### Customer Churn Prediction

In collaboration with the SyriaTel Telecommunication Company, I worked on predicting customer churn within the telecommunications industry. Through thorough analysis of a dataset and the utilization of classification algorithms, this project successfully identified key factors influencing customer churn. The strategies developed for customer retention are rooted in these insights, ultimately enhancing business performance and curbing revenue loss attributed to churn. 

### Modelling House Sale Prices

This project harnessed the power of multiple regression analysis to decipher the intricate dynamics of the housing market in King County. By dissecting various features of houses, such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and square footage, I aimed to unveil the most impactful factors shaping house sale prices. These findings hold the potential to aid sellers in targeting the right buyers, refining marketing strategies, and making well-informed investment decisions.
